ClassMate is a zero-dependency Java library for accurately introspecting type information, including reliable resolution of generic type declarations for both classes ("types") and members (fields, methods and constructors).

h1. Resolving Class type information

Main class used for fully resolving type information for classes is '''com.fasterxml.classmate.TypeResolver'''. Its main resolution methods are:

 * resolve(Class cls): given a plain old class, will use generic type information that super type declarations (extends, implements) may have.
 * resolve(GenericType<T>): given a subtype of '''GenericType''' (which uses "Super-type Token" pattern, see http://gafter.blogspot.com/2006/12/super-type-tokens.html), fully resolve type information
 * resolve(Class<?> baseType, Class<?> typeParameter1, ... , Class<?> typeParameter2): given base type (like '''List.class''') and zero or more type parameters (either as '''Class'''es to resolve, or as '''ResolvedType'''s), resolves type information
