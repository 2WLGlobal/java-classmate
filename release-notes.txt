Release notes:

0.8.0:

* Combine various ResolvedType.resolve(...) methods, using `java.lang.reflect.Type`
  as common super type
* Changed order arguments for "resolve" that takes TypeBindings and Type, to prevent
  problems with overloading: now TypeBindings is the first argument, not second

0.7.0:

* [Issue#11]: ResolvedType uses `java.lang.reflect.Type` to allow combination
  of Class<?>, GenericType and ResolvedType.
* [Issue#12]: ResolvedType now implements `java.lang.reflect.Type`

0.5.4:

* [Issue#4]: problems with self-referential type variables
